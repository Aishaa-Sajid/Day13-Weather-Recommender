# Day13-Weather-Recommender
Okay, here's a README.md file for your Weather Recommendation Tool project, suitable for your GitHub repository.

Weather Recommendation Tool (Day 13 of #100DaysofWeb)
Overview
This repository contains the code for a simple Weather Recommendation Tool, developed as part of Day 13 of my #100DaysofWeb self-learning journey. This project is a pure JavaScript application that demonstrates fundamental programming logic, user interaction, and conditional execution.

The tool prompts the user for current weather conditions and temperature, then provides a personalized activity recommendation based on the input.

Concepts Explored
This project primarily focuses on solidifying core JavaScript fundamentals:

User Input (prompt()): Effectively gathering information from the user via browser prompts.
User Output (alert()): Displaying dynamic messages and recommendations back to the user via browser alerts.
Conditional Logic (if-else if-else statements): Implementing complex decision-making structures to provide different recommendations based on various weather conditions (e.g., "sunny", "rainy", "snowy", "cloudy").
Nested Conditionals: Utilizing if statements within other if blocks to create more granular and precise recommendations based on multiple criteria (e.g., sunny AND hot, rainy AND cold).
Data Type Conversion (Number()): Converting string input received from prompt() into numerical data types for accurate mathematical comparisons (e.g., checking temperature ranges).
String Manipulation (.toLowerCase()): Processing user input to ensure case-insensitive comparisons for weather conditions, making the application more robust and user-friendly.
